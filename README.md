## Hexamite hx19 positioning system java library

The code here will eventually provide a java library and user interface to control and read Hexamites hx19 ultrasonic position devices.

Status: Contains proof of concept for reading and writing to the device using 'java simple serial comm' library.

Before building, [jssc.jar](https://github.com/scream3r/java-simple-serial-connector/releases/) must be downloaded and placed in the lib/ folder.

The code is tested on Ubuntu Linux 12.4 with Java 7 but should work on any recent Linux, Mac or Windows / Java combination.
